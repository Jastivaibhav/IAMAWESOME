Narrator:Once there was a kingdom,It was ruled by fools.They didn't want to run their kingdom regularly like the other kings.So,they 
changed day into night and night into day.They decreed that everyone should work at the night and sleep at the day.Anyone who 
disobeyed this order would be punished to death.Everyone because of the fear of death obeyed these foolish rules.One day a Guru
and his disciple decided to visit the city.The city was beautiful but there was no man in sight.They were amazed and roamed around 
the city till evening when everyone suddenly started to open their shops and started going to work.
</p>

<p>
Narrator:As they didn't eat anything the entire day they were hungry and went to a shop to buy some food but to their astonishment everything
cost exactly a duddu.Everything ranging from a sack of rice to a bunch of bananas cost a duddu.They were delighted as they could buy 
what ever they wanted for a duddu.After they had eaten a proper meal,the guru said:
</p>

<p>
Guru:This is no place for us,let us leave
</p>

<p>
Narrator:But the disciple was reluctant to leave as he liked it here.
</p>

<p>
Guru:They are all fools.This is a bad place to settle down.One day they might even harm you.
</p>

<p>
Narrator:The disciple wouldn't listen.He stayed back over ate a lot and became fat.
</p>

<p>
Narrator:One day a thief broke into a rich merchant's house,but a wall fell on him before he could escape.
</p>

<p>
Narrator:Later in the court.The thief's brother went and complained.
</p>

<p>
TB(Thief's Brother):Your Highness, when my brother was pursuing his ancient trade,a wall fell on him and killed him. This merchant is 
to blame. He should have built a good, strong wall. You must punish the wrongdoer and compensate the family for this injustice.
</p>

<p>
King:Justice will be done. Donâ€™t worry,summon the owner of this house!Now!.
</p>

<p>
Narrator:When the merchant arrived.
</p>

<p>
King:What is your name.
</p>

<p>
Merchant:Such and Such, your highness.
</p>

<p>
King:A thief came to rob your house but the wall was weak and it fell on him,because of you a poor man is now dead.
</p>

<p>
Merchant:My lord,I didn't build the wall ,it is fault of the builder.
</p>

<p>
King:And,who built the wall.
</p>

<p>
Merchant:It was built in my father's time.I know who built it,he lives nearby.
</p>

<p>
Narrator:The king sent messengers to bring the mason. 
</p>

Mason:Yes my lord I did.
</p>

<p>
King:What kind of wall did you build it now fell on a man and killed him.
</p>

<p>
Mason:I remember very well why I couldn't build the wall properly,it was because of a dancing girl,she walked along the road all day with
her anklets jingling,that is why couldn't concentrate.I know where she lives.
</p>
<p>
King:Your right the case deepens,Summon the dancer at once!.
